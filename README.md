# LSTMStockAnalysis

Given data-rich history of Lennar, we use its historical price movements to predict future returns (_ceteris paribus_)
We use Long-Short Term Memory algorithms to predict future share prices of Lennar Corporation (LEN) in order to achieve this.

Best fit lines indicate 'predicted fit' of the model.
